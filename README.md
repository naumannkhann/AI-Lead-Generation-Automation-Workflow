# AI-Lead-Generation-Automation-Workflow #
Manual lead generation is slow, repetitive, and expensive — so here is an end-to-end automated lead generation workflow using n8n + SERP API.

What this automation does:
*Searches Google for businesses using targeted keywords.
*Extracts relevant company websites.
*Fetches website homepages automatically.
*Extracts real business contact emails.
*Removes duplicates & irrelevant data.
*Adds timestamps for tracking.
*Stores clean leads in Google Sheets.

Tech Stack Used:
*n8n (Workflow Automation)
*SERP API (Google Search Results)
*JavaScript (Data cleaning & filtering)
*HTTP Web Scraping
*Google Sheets (Lead database)

Why this matters:
This workflow is designed with a production-level architecture — modular, scalable, and ready to integrate email outreach or CRM tools later.
